Start to port app/*.js to app/*.html by only including
butiran.js (or butiran.min.js).
Try to create output for substituting console since it will
be called from a HTML file. Candidate is a textarea.

sandbox/die/testfs.js for this.
Move app/fsgd.js and app/fcbs.js to app/js and later to be
converted to html based application not js.
