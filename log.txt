Still do something.
Adjust width and height of canvas with define using style.
Check whether text() and graphic() accessed properly and throw error when not.
Fix message error.
Canvas has dafault text and curve.
setContentId, push, pop, clear for textarea are ok, but it still fells like something not too right. It will be change.

Today plan is to convert or transfor tabtext.js and tabcanvas.js, where the later has not yet worked, to object and create a better procedure in giving id for each canvas or simply draw using object function instead of directly accessing the canvas.

First is to calm self down and thinkin about the name. The idea is to have tabs of textarea and canvas which can be shown by clicking appropriate button. The textarea and canvas can be used as I/O for UI (or GUI). Tab as the beginning maybe ok. And the content could be flexible, which are textarea and canvas? Maybe it is better to design it in gstd.html instead directly using node.js, just of efficiency of transpiling.

tabtext.js and tabcanvas.js can not declare more than once since they have not unique id. It must be fixed.

It works

6
Change log.txt file

7

Confusing with git bash. And still. It works and tested again.
Recreate directory and test update.

Start to port app/*.js to app/*.html by only including
butiran.js (or butiran.min.js).
Try to create output for substituting console since it will
be called from a HTML file. Candidate is a textarea.
Library of fs for writing file is not work with weback. See
sandbox/die/testfs.js for this.
Move app/fsgd.js and app/fcbs.js to app/js and later to be
converted to html based application not js.
